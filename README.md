## üîí Identity and Access Management System for Aged Care

ElderSafe Connect is a comprehensive Identity and Access Management (IAM) system designed
specifically for aged care facilities. The platform implements robust security features to protect sensitive
health information while providing role-based access control for administrators, nursing staff, and
caregivers.

## üéì Academic Project Information

```
University : Swinburne University of Technology
Unit Code : ICT
Unit Name : ICT Project A
Submission Date : May 18, 2025
Instructor : [Instructor Name]
```
## üìã Project Overview

ElderSafe Connect was developed to address security and access management challenges faced by aged
care facilities. The system implements a layered security approach to protect sensitive resident data while
ensuring appropriate staff members can access the information required for their roles.

### Key Features

```
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) : Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) integration with QR
code setup
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) : Granular access permissions for administrators, nurses, and
carers
JWT Authentication : Secure session management using JSON Web Tokens
Password Security : Strong password policies with bcrypt hashing and HIBP verification
Honeypot System : Deceptive security mechanism to detect and track potential intruders
Activity Logging : Comprehensive monitoring of user actions and security events
Supabase Integration : Secure database and authentication backend
Resident Care Plans : Role-appropriate access to health information
```

```
Responsive Design : Mobile-friendly interface for use across devices

```
bash
gitgit clone https://github.com/your-username/eldersafe-connect.git clone https://github.com/your-username/eldersafe-connect.git
cdcd eldersafe-connect eldersafe-connect
```
```
bash
python -m venv venvpython -m venv venv
sourcesource venv/bin/activate venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate# On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
4. Create a .env file with the following variables:
5. Create the required certificates for HTTPS:

### Running the Application

1. Start the main application:
2. Access the application:
    Main application: https://localhost:
    Honeypot system: [http://localhost:](http://localhost:)

## üîÑ Development Workflow

The project was developed using an Agile-inspired approach with two major sprints:

```
Sprint 1 : Core security infrastructure (JWT, MFA, RBAC, Honeypot)
Sprint 2 : User experience enhancements, password reset functionality, and visual refinements
```
## üîí Security Features

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Users are required to set up MFA using authenticator apps that implement Time-based One-Time
Passwords (TOTP). This provides an additional layer of security beyond password authentication.

### Password Security

```
Strong password requirements (length, complexity)
Bcrypt hashing with salting
Integration with Have I Been Pwned API to prevent use of compromised passwords
Secure password reset functionality
```
### Honeypot System

A decoy system designed to detect unauthorized access attempts. Triggers email alerts to administrators
when potential intrusions are detected.

### Access Control

Granular role-based access control ensures users can only access information relevant to their
responsibilities:

```
Admins: full system access
Nurses: write access to assigned residents
Carers: read-only access to assigned residents
```
## üìä Monitoring

The system includes comprehensive logging for:

```
Authentication attempts
JWT token issuance and validation
Honeypot triggers
```

```
User activities (care plan submissions, etc.)
```
